Game            Status              Notes

15PUZZLE        Playable
BLINKY          Nothing             Draws garbage, totally nonfunctional
BLITZ           Intro               Gets in game and loses immediately
CONNECT4        Playable
GUESS           Unknown             Not sure how this game works
HIDDEN          Playable/Unknown    Seems to work, but I think there should be a delay after you select the second card
INVADERS        Ingame              Works, but hit detection seems very buggy
KALEID          Playable/Unknown    Makes kaleidoscope patterns, but needs a lot of button mashing, then goes by itself. Not sure if intended
MAZE            Playable
MERLIN          Playable
MISSILE         Ingame              Works OK, hit detection seems buggy, score is always 40
PONG            Playable
PONG2           Playable
PUZZLE          Playable
SYZYGY          Ingame              Unplayably buggy
TANK            Playable
TETRIS          Intro               Draws the game area, but pieces spawn as a buggy mess at the top and don't fall
TICTAC          Playable
UFO             Playable
VBRIX           Playable            Not sure how this game works but it seems to work ok
VERS            Intro               Shows game screen, then the right player autoloses
WIPEOFF         Ingame              Ball just bounces around on top screen a lot. I don't think it should work this way
